# GE-461-Dimensionality-Reduction-and-Data-Visualization

Hi, 

This repository contains my work for the second project of the GE-461: Introduction to Data Science course. 

The project involves dimensionality reduction and data vizualization for MNIST dataset. In order to evaluate the performance, we use a Quadratic Gaussian classifier. 
We experiment with Principal  Component  Analysis  (PCA) and Linear  Discriminant  Analysis  (LDA) in order  to determine  their  effect  on  classification  error.
We  use  more  complex  techniques  such  as Sammonâ€™s mapping, and t-Distributed  Stochastic  Neighbor  Embedding  to  visualize  our  high dimensional data in two dimension.
